# AI CASE STUDY [Module 1 Challenge]

## DATABRICKS: Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2013 by seven UC Berkeley academics — Ali Ghodsi, Matei Zaharia, Arsalan Tavakoli-Shiraji, Patrick Wendell, Reynold Xin, Andy Konwinski and Ion Soica

* Databricks grew out of the AMPLab project at University of California, Berkeley; while its founders were students there. AMPLab no longer exists but it allowed students to produce reports and projects focused on big data analytics. [^1] Their vision was to simplify and democratize data and AI, helping data teams solve problems in a more efficient way by supporting existing tools in one intuitive platform. [^2]

* The company has received USD $3.5 Billion in funding and has over 5000 employees [^3]

## Business Activities

* Databricks solution is geared heavily towards data scientists allowing for real time analytics within workspaces that allows for collaborative work between Teams, if needed. Databricks develops a web-based platform for working with Spark, that provides automated cluster management and IPython-style notebooks.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  Databricks offers a custom model approach that ties into its flagship data “lakehouse” offering in which customers store and conduct analysis on raw data. This concept and solution is their competitive advantage and what makes them unique from other competitors. Here's how they came up with this "lakehouse" concept:

  > The data lakehouse is an open data architecture that combines the best of data warehouse and data lakes on one platform. Now you can store all your data - structure, semi-structured and unstructured - in your open data lake and still get the data quality, performance, security and governance you expect from a data warehouse. This makes lakehouse the only data architecture that supports business intelligence, SQL analytics, real time data applications, data science and machine learning in one platform! [^4]

* In short, a Data Lakehouse is an architecture that enables efficient and secure Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Intelligence (BI) directly on vast amounts of data stored in Data Lakes.
  Data lakehouse systems implement the same SQL interface as traditional data warehouses, so analysts can connect to them in existing BI and SQL tools without changing their workflows. For example, leading BI products such as Tableau, PowerBI, Qlik, and Looker can all connect to data lakehouse systems, data engineering tools like Fivetran and dbt can run against them, and analysts can export data into desktop tools such as Microsoft Excel. Lakehouse's support for ANSI SQL, fine-grained access control, and ACID transactions enables administrators to manage them the same way as data warehouse systems but cover all the data in their organization in one system.
  
  One important advantage of Lakehouse systems in simplicity is that they manage all the data in the organization, so data analysts can be granted access to work with raw and historical data as it arrives instead of only the subset of data loaded into a data warehouse system. An analyst can therefore easily ask questions that span multiple historical datasets or establish a new pipeline for working with a new dataset without blocking on a database administrator or data engineer to load the appropriate data. Built-in support for AI also makes it easy for analysts to run AI models built by a machine learning team on any data. [^5]
