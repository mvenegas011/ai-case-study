# AI CASE STUDY [Module 1 Challenge]

## DATABRICKS: Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2013 by seven UC Berkeley academics — Ali Ghodsi, Matei Zaharia, Arsalan Tavakoli-Shiraji, Patrick Wendell, Reynold Xin, Andy Konwinski and Ion Soica

* Databricks grew out of the AMPLab project at University of California, Berkeley; while its founders were students there. AMPLab no longer exists but it allowed students to produce reports and projects focused on big data analytics. [^1] Their vision was to simplify and democratize data and AI, helping data teams solve problems in a more efficient way by supporting existing tools in one intuitive platform. [^2]

* The company has received USD $3.5 Billion in funding and has over 5000 employees [^3]

## Business Activities

* Databricks solution is geared heavily towards data scientists allowing for real time analytics within workspaces that allows for collaborative work between Teams, if needed. Databricks develops a web-based platform for working with Spark, that provides automated cluster management and IPython-style notebooks.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  Databricks offers a custom model approach that ties into its flagship data “lakehouse” offering in which customers store and conduct analysis on raw data. This concept and solution is their competitive advantage and what makes them unique from other competitors. Here's how they came up with this "lakehouse" concept:

  > The data lakehouse is an open data architecture that combines the best of data warehouse and data lakes on one platform. Now you can store all your data - structure, semi-structured and unstructured - in your open data lake and still get the data quality, performance, security and governance you expect from a data warehouse. This makes lakehouse the only data architecture that supports business intelligence, SQL analytics, real time data applications, data science and machine learning in one platform! [^4]

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
