# AI CASE STUDY [Module 1 Challenge]

## DATABRICKS: Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2013 by seven UC Berkeley academics — Ali Ghodsi, Matei Zaharia, Arsalan Tavakoli-Shiraji, Patrick Wendell, Reynold Xin, Andy Konwinski and Ion Soica

* Databricks grew out of the AMPLab project at University of California, Berkeley; while its founders were students there. AMPLab no longer exists but it allowed students to produce reports and projects focused on big data analytics. [^1] Their vision was to simplify and democratize data and AI, helping data teams solve problems in a seamless and user-friendly way. [^2]

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
